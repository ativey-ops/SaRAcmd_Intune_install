# SaRAcmd_script_install
Installs the commandline tool SaRAcmd to perform maintenance on Office products silently, including removal. 
Works with Intune and Autopilot. Within this script, the Office apps are being removed automatically. 

For a full list of the SaRAcmd tool's capabilities, see Microsoft's documentation:

I provided this script to Microsoft Support after they failed to provide an out-of-box means to remove the Office apps via Intune. I did grant them permission to provide it to other customers. 

I do not typically work with PowerShell, and have more experience working with Linux - hence the mixture of commands and aliases.
